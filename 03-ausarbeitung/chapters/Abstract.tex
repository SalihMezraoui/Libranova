This thesis presents \textit{LibraNova}, a modern, web-based full-stack application designed to facilitate the digital management of a library and the efficient organization of book lending. The project aims to provide both users and administrators with an intuitive, performant, and secure platform that fully supports the lending process digitally. 

\noindent The application is built using \textbf{Spring Boot} for the backend and \textbf{React} with TypeScript for the frontend. Users can search for books, check their real-time availability, and read or write reviews. Administrators are equipped with tools to manage the book inventory and communicate with users. 

\noindent To secure sensitive functions, modern authentication and authorization techniques such as \textbf{JWT} and \textbf{OAuth2} via Okta are employed. For paid library services, the \textbf{Stripe API} ensures secure payment processing. Persistent data storage is handled via the \textbf{MySQL database}. 

\noindent The application supports both \textbf{English and German languages} and emphasizes \textbf{accessibility} to ensure broad user access. Special attention was given to a responsive user interface, consistent UX design, and quality assurance through automated testing using \textbf{JUnit} and \textbf{Mockito}. \textit{LibraNova} demonstrates how modern web technologies can be leveraged to create a scalable and user-friendly solution for library management.
