# LibraNova: Full-Stack Library Management System with Spring Boot and React 

This project was developed as part of my **Bachelorarbeit (Bachelor‚Äôs Thesis)**.

## Overview

**LibraNova** is a modern, responsive library management web application designed to enhance the user experience for both readers and administrators. Built with **React** (frontend) and **Spring Boot** (backend), the application enables users to search for books, borrow available titles, submit reviews, and interact with real-time book data. Administrators can efficiently manage the catalog, track borrowing activities, and respond to user inquiries.

The application also features a robust **authentication and authorization** system using **JWT**, **OAuth2**, and **OpenID Connect**, and integrates **Stripe API** for secure payments related to premium library services.
